      <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/FinalTheory/wireless-network-reproduction">Wireless Network Reproduction</a> (aka WNR) is a network emulator which allows developers to exactly reproduce any kind of terrible network condition on your own mobile device, or even Android/iOS emulators running on Mac OS.</p>

<p><img src="/wireless-network-reproduction/images/interface.png" width="500px"></img></p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Aspects that can be controlled by WNR include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bandwidth</li>
<li>Latency</li>
<li>Packet loss</li>
<li>Packet corruption</li>
<li>Packet reordering</li>
<li>Packet duplication</li>
<li>Packet throttling</li>
</ul>

<p>You could run WNR in two different mode:</p>

<ol>
<li>Gateway Mode: First share your internet connection through <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18704">Internet-Sharing</a>, and then WNR would shape / interfere the network traffic between your MacBook and your mobile device, just like a router.</li>
<li>Emulator Mode: Just start an Android / iOS emulator, specify the process name in WNR, and then you will have emulated network condition in your virtual machine. In this mode you don&#39;t need a real mobile phone.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Advantages</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Extremely Customizable</strong>: WNR is designed to <strong>reproduce</strong> any type of network condition, which means that it is not just simply shaping the network traffic like <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/tc"><code>tc</code></a> or <a href="http://facebook.github.io/augmented-traffic-control/"><code>ATC</code></a>, but forcing the network to act as some specific pattern. With WNR, we could not only produce a bandwidth limited network, but also make the bandwidth vary by time, and even approach a user defined curve. The example configuration is <a href="https://github.com/FinalTheory/wireless-network-reproduction/blob/master/macdivert/examples/bandwidth.json">here</a>, and its actual effect is shown below.</li>
<li><strong>Apply on Process</strong>: When running WNR on your host, you can choose to shape network traffic <strong>only for a specific process</strong>, and dump the entire conversation into a <code>.pcap</code> file, which could be used for detailed analyze.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>A MacBook running OS X Yosemite / EI Capitan</li>
<li>An Android/iOS mobile phone, or emulators like <a href="https://www.genymotion.com">GenyMotion</a>, <a href="http://www.droid4x.com">Droid4X</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>For Chinese users, please download WNR through <a href="http://pan.baidu.com/s/1eRwLDQy">Baidu Yun</a>.</p>

<p>For other users, check <a href="https://github.com/FinalTheory/wireless-network-reproduction/releases">Github releases</a> for latest build.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download WNR from URL links above.</li>
<li>Extract and save it into your hard drive.</li>
<li>Run this app, click &quot;Network Emulator&quot; button, and enter your root password.</li>
<li>If this is your first time to run this, you need to disable kernel extension checking according to the prompt.</li>
<li>Restart your Mac and run this app again, you may see the emulator interface shown above.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Add Configuration&quot; and select a default configuration or your customized ones.</li>
<li>If you need to inspect on packets transmitted from / to your device, then select a position to save <code>.pcap</code> files.</li>
<li>If you want to run emulation on real device, then start &quot;Internet-Sharing&quot; of macOS, and switch emulator mode to &quot;WiFi&quot; instead of &quot;Local&quot;.</li>
<li>If you want to run emulation on Android virtual machine, you need to specify the PID or process name (&quot;vboxheadless&quot; for VirtualBox based Android emulators) of your Android emulator.</li>
<li>Finally, when everything is ready, click &quot;Start&quot; and check if the emulator is working as expected.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notice</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>DO NOT</strong> run this application directly in dmg image!!! You should first extract it from image, save it into a local folder, and then try to run it.</li>
<li>Path to the application should <strong>NOT</strong> contain any non-ASCII characters, otherwise it would encounter an error.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Network Emulation</h3>

<p>The following animation shows the basic usages of WNR.</p>

<h3>Bandwidth Limitation</h3>

<p>The following animation shows how to limit bandwidth of a specific process such as <code>wget</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/wireless-network-reproduction/images/bandwidth.gif"></img></p>

<h3>TCP Connection Analyze</h3>

<p>We use a time-related function <code>bandwidth(t) = 256 + 1024 * sin(t/4) (KB/s)</code> to emulate some sort of dynamic bandwidth limitation, and then use TCP data visualization of WNR to show the actual bandwidth variation, which results in the figure shown below:</p>
